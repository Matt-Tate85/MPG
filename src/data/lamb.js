      <h2>Leg of Lamb</h2>
      <p>The leg of lamb is one of the most popular and versatile cuts, perfect for roasting. It's taken from the hindquarter of the animal and provides lean, tender meat with excellent flavor.</p>
      
      <h3>Characteristics</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Relatively lean with a layer of fat on the outside</li>
        <li>Tender and flavorful</li>
        <li>Versatile - can be roasted whole, butterflied, or cut into steaks</li>
        <li>Traditional choice for Sunday roasts and special occasions</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Cooking Methods</h3>
      <p><strong>Roasting:</strong> The most popular method. Roast at 180°C for approximately 20-25 minutes per 500g plus 20 minutes for medium. For the best results, rest for at least 15 minutes before carving.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Butterflying:</strong> A butterflied leg has had the bone removed and the meat opened out flat, which allows for quicker, more even cooking. Excellent for barbecuing or grilling.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Steaks:</strong> Leg steaks are cut across the muscle and can be pan-fried or grilled quickly for a convenient meal.</p>

      <h2>Shoulder of Lamb</h2>
      <p>The shoulder of lamb comes from the forequarter of the animal and is a hard-working muscle, which means it has more connective tissue than the leg. This makes it perfect for slow cooking, which transforms it into meltingly tender meat with a rich, deep flavor.</p>
      
      <h3>Characteristics</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Higher fat content than leg, making it incredibly flavorful</li>
        <li>Contains more connective tissue, which breaks down during slow cooking</li>
        <li>Economical compared to premium cuts</li>
        <li>Perfect for pulling or shredding once cooked</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Cooking Methods</h3>
      <p><strong>Slow Roasting:</strong> The most popular method. Cook at a low temperature (160°C) for a long time (3-4 hours) until the meat is falling off the bone.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Braising:</strong> Cut into pieces and cook slowly in liquid with vegetables and herbs.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Pot Roasting:</strong> Similar to braising but with the joint kept whole, cooked in a covered pot with liquid.</p>
